# Digital-Forensics Research Criminal Investigation Lab
In this project, I collaborated with three other teammates on a project that simulated uncovering evidence that a suspect hides. The suspect stored evidence within files on a hard drive, and each picture within those files uncovers clues about his interests, hobbies, and plans, which aim toward his potential attack. As digital forensics investigators, we uploaded the files from the hard drive onto the data analysis tools FTK Toolkit and Autopsy. We documented various photos that led us to the source of his plans. We faced an obstacle: we did not know why we saw pictures unrelated to our findings in his deleted files section. However, we later realized that the suspect utilized the process of Steganography to embed data within a .jpeg file to reduce suspicion. We took images in his deleted files section, ran them through the Steganography tool Steg, extracted the data, and revealed the plans for his attack.
